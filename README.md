# drum-set
A drum set responsive with both clicks and/or keyboard inputs... Growing up I always loved drums, I even once had a drum set of my own as a kid. When the drum set developed issues, I ended up turning any household item in sight into my personal drum set. So its only fitting I recreate a drum set in the form of a site.  (HTML5 + CSS3 +ES2015)
